# Salary Prediction

This small ML app predicts the salary of a person based on the years of experience, the level of education achieved and the country of origin. 

The data comes from Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020. The data is available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#developer-profile-developer-type).

The app uses Streamlit to create the front-end and Scikit-learn to create the model.
